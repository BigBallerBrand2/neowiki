---

neowiki (stylized 'neowiki', all lowercase) began as an alternative to the only other neocities wiki at the time,
[Penny's Pages](//thewikion.neocities.org/wiki/), headed by the sometimes-unagreeable-with [OwlMan](//owlman.neocities.org).

neowiki was originally created by [minerobber](//minerobber.neocities.org), and originally was hosted under his neocities site
as "https://minerobber.neocities.org/neowiki/". Eventually, in order to give himself more breathing room with the project (and
in order to allow others to work on neowiki if he wasn't around to update it on his site), he moved it to [its own subdomain](https://github.com/MineRobber9000/neowiki/pull/14),
[realneowiki.neocities.org](//neocities.org/site/realneowiki), where it now resides.

neowiki has a [Discord server][discord] and 5 buttons.

There are 3 buttons with a space theme, originally designed as a dawn (green) / day (blue) / dusk (dusk (dark blue)) rotation:

 - [![SpaceGreen](/buttons/spacegreen.gif)](/buttons/spacegreen.gif)
 - [![SpaceBlue](/buttons/spaceblue.gif)](/buttons/spaceblue.gif)
 - [![SpaceDusk](/buttons/spacedusk.gif)](/buttons/spacedusk.gif)

There are 2 buttons featuring the neowiki logo:

 - [![LogoGreen](/buttons/logogreen.gif)](/buttons/logogreen.gif)
 - [![LogoBlue](/buttons/logoblue.gif)](/buttons/logoblue.gif)
