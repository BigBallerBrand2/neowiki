This wiki tries to be consistent on at least a basic level. Here are some tips:

 - Use ISO-8601 dates when you abbreviate, but in all other cases use American dates.
 - Use the Oxford comma. (i.e; "minerobber bought eggs, cheese, and ham.")
 - No slang, unless it's in a quote.
 - Try to stay neutral, no matter how you feel about the topic.

## How to use images

Using images in an article is OK, but there are some rules to follow.

 - Try not to use copyrighted images. If you must use copyrighted images, do not center the article around them. (Fair use requires copyrighted works to not be the main focus.)
 - Try to use royalty free photos or take screenshots of pages.

[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a good place to find royalty-free images.

### Making images

 - Don't make the image too big so it distracts from the article content.
 - Don't make it sillier than it needs to be.
 - No sketches (unless you're demonstrating, say, the work of an artist on Neocities.)
 - If there is copyrighted content in the picture, make sure it falls under Fair Use.

## References

If you reference something, make sure to link it.
For people, unless they have a person page on neowiki, you should link their neocities site.

## People

Don't reference people by full real name, even if you know it. Also, don't bring up facts about people that aren't relevant to the article topic.
Use gender neutral pronouns. (they/them/etc.)
Only write about what people do in the sphere of Neocities and Neocities-related projects, unless it's relevant to the article topic.
You are allowed to write about yourself. (Though that may seem narcissistic.)
Until I ([minerobber](//minerobber.neocities.org)) implement categories (or anyone else implements categories, this is an open wiki after all), please start
the filenames of articles on people with `people-`. For example, an article on Kyle Drake would be named `people-kyledrake.md`. Once categories are implemented,
those may be used instead.

## Quotes

If you quote someone or something, give credit. Also, try not to make an article that is one big quote.
